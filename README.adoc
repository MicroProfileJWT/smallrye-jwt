= SmallRye JWT

SmallRye JWT is a library for implementing the {microprofile-jwt}[{mp-jwt-name}]. Currently it is focused on supporting the MP-JWT 1.1 spec, and primarily deals with the parsing of the JWT string into a JsonWebToken implementation.

In the future, when MP-JWT 2.0 can build on the JSR-375 security APIs, there should be more support for defining the CDI extension and security layer integration.
